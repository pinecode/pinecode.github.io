description: Pinecode worked with Sophie MacKenzie of <a href="http://wholeheartedeats.com" title="Whole Hearted Eats">Whole Hearted Eats</a> to refresh her food blog - Inside and out. We moved her from Blogger to a self-hosted WordPress installation, fresh with a custom theme accompanied by several plugins to make her work easier.
